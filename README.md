## CureBPPV App

Refer to the [Wiki](https://coursework.cs.duke.edu/CompSci408_2017Fall/app_bppv/wikis/home).

## Development

To run the app, follow the [React Native Getting Started Guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#installing-dependencies).

Use [React Native Debugger](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger) for debugging. After installing the debugger, just open the debugger, and debug the app by "start remote debugging".
