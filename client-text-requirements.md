Reword to: Once you are diagnosed with BPPV, this app will be an educational tool to aid you in at-home treatment.
To begin, please select which ear is being treated.
 
FYIàwe need to call it an educational tool for at-home treatment rather than a self-treatment device due to FDA regulations.

ADD some emphasis up top by adding:
**IMPORTANT**
Before you begin place a pillow behind you, so that on lying back it will be under your shoulders.  Your head should not be on the pillow.

I think breaking up this text so that you see the instructions on the process of the app itself first would be helpful.  That is, we walk the patient through how to use the app and what is the patient supposed to be doing with the face and the two noses on their screen.
 
Consider making several screens/pages with the following (I know the language is fairly basic—but medical instructions are supposed to be no greater than a 5th grade reading level):
 
This app will help you move your head into the correct positions for the treatment maneuver.  [they select: next / go back home]
 
To do this, keep your nose pointing to the black nose on the screen. ALWAYS rotate your head and phone together.   [they select: next / go back home]
 
Instructions are provided for each step.  Read or listen to each step prior to moving your head. [they select: next / go back home]
 
When your head is in the correct location the white nose and black nose will be on top of each other and the timer will begin. Once you are in the correct position, you will stay for 30 seconds before moving to the next step.  The app will tell you when to move to the next step. [they select: next / go back home]
 
If your head is not in the correct location, move your head and phone so that the white and black nose are lined up. The timer will not start until you are in the correct position. [they select: I am ready to begin / go back home]
 
Screenshot 4-6: 
In terms of text, I think we can remove: “keep your nose pointing to the black nose…etc”.  Simplify to just have the instructions for the head movement.  I will reiterate the nose information in the audio recordings
 
Screenshot 7:  Please put “sit up on the right side” on own page followed by a page with “treatment finished” and the survey information.
